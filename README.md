# React Testing Crash Course

## About

This is me following Brad Traversy's guest Techbase [youtube video](https://youtu.be/OVNjsIto9xM)

Year 2021

## A note

So this app takes literally forever to run and my pc freezes when it does. The same goes for tests. So I left off pretty musch right after a little further than Demo app setup at [11:06](https://youtu.be/OVNjsIto9xM). I'll try to continue after I get a better hardware

## Most common testing types

- Unit tests (testing small part of the code)
- Integrations tests (testing combinations of unit tests)
- End-to-end tests (testing from front to back)

## This is what was in here initially

Thanks to team Cypress for this real world demo app ❤️
